星际争霸2 自动注卵宏

The macro can automatically help zerg players spawn Larva.

If you want use this macro,you need to make "TownCamera=space","CameraSaveX=Control+F6","ControlGroupAssignX=Ctrl+9","ControlGroupRecallX=9"(where X can be any number from 0 to 9)

Apparently, "SpawnLarva=V(I forget its English name.whatever you definitely know what am i talking about)"

It's better to place your base at "1" and main army at "3" and they must be Group buttons similar to "9" above.

If the settings above are not available, something may go wrong.

Of course,u can change the settings according to your preference
